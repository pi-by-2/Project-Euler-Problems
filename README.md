This repo contains solved problems from Project Euler. Named after the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler, the website contains mathematical problems which are meant to be solved by computer programs. It ranges from fairly average to daunting problems. The codes will be available in Python. I will be posting the codes as I solve them. So excuse me if codes are not that neat! 
Feel free to suggest changes if necessary. 

The ordering of the questions are not according to the website.
