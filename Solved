Q1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Sol. 

mylist=[]
for i in range(1, 1000):
    if (i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0):
        mylist.append(i)
print (sum(mylist))

Output: 233168

Q2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Sol. 

first = 0
second = 1
last = first + second 
mylist = []

print (last)

while (last<4000000):

    first = second
    second = last
    last = first+second 
    
    if (last < 4000000 and last%2==0):
        mylist.append(last)

print (sum (mylist))

Output: 4613732
